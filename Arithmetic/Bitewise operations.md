## Bitewise operations.

When a computer directly manipulates bits. Used alot in network and assembly programming.

### NOT:  
  
  Flips bits. Zeros become one and ones become zero
  
    NOT 1101 = 0010
   
## AND: 

   Performs a logical AND between the bits of its operands. 
   If both comparing positions are ones, the result is one, otherwise it is zero.
   
     Note: In computer programming, an operand is a term used to describe any object that is capable of being manipulated. For example, in "1 + 2" the "1" and "2" are the operands and the plus symbol is the operator.
     
     1001 AND 1100 = 1000
     
## OR: 

   Performs a logical OR between the bits of its operands.
   
   If at least one of the bits in the comparing position is one, the result is one.
   
    1001 OR 1100 = 1101
   
## XOR:
 
   Performs a logical exclusive OR between the bits of its operands.
   
   If just one of the bits in the comparing position is one, the results is one, otherwise it is zero.
   
    1001 XOR 1100 = 0101
