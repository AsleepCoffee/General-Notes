# Endianess

Way of representing (storing) values in memory.



**Little Endian** is where the value is arranged from the least significant byte (LSB) to the most significant byte(MSB):

**Big Endian** is where the value is arranged from the MSB to the LSB.


MSB (Most significant bit): binary number is the largest value, usually the first from the left.example, binary number 100 the MSB if 1. 

LSB(least significant bit): binary number is the lowest values, usually the first from the right. 110, the LSB is 0. 


In big-endian, the LSB is stored at the highest memory address, and MSB at the lowest mem addr.

Little-endian, the LSB is stored at the lower mem addr while MSB is at the highest mem addr.
