# Endianess

In programs, binary information is represented in hexadecimal format. Different architectures actually represent the same hexadecimal number in different ways, and this is what is referred to as Endianess. 

Letâ€™s take the value of 0x12345678 as an example. Here the least significant value is the right most value(78) while the most significant value is the left most value(12).

**Little Endian** is where the value is arranged from the least significant byte (LSB) to the most significant byte(MSB):

**Big Endian** is where the value is arranged from the MSB to the LSB.
