Federation: 
    
   One system is responsible for the authentication of a user. A service provider (SP or RP) would send an assertion to an IDP that contains the account name and other SP/RP attributes for the session. This is crypto signed so the SP/RP can trust it came from the right IDP. An IDP can be federated to multiple SPs/RPs to allow for a single point of authentication for the user.

   Idnetity Provider. An entity that create, maintains, and manages authetications for SPs/RPs.
