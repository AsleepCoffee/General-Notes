# Termonology

**Operands:** In computer programming, an operand is a term used to describe any object that is capable of being manipulated. For example, in "1 + 2" the "1" and "2" are the operands and the plus symbol is the operator.
     

**Bitwise operations:** When a computer directly manipulates bits. Use alot in network and assembly programming.

**Federation:** One system is responsible for the authentication of a user. A service provider (SP or RP) would send an assertion to an IDP that contains the account name and other SP/RP attributes for the session. This is crypto signed so the SP/RP can trust it came from the right IDP. An IDP can be federated to multiple SPs/RPs to allow for a single point of authentication for the user.
    
**IDP:** Idnetity Provider. An entity that create, maintains, and manages authetications for SPs/RPs. SP/RP does not care how the IDP operates, only that a trusted response is recived. 


**Heap** A heap is an area of pre-reserved computer main storage ( memory ) that a program process can use to store data in some variable amount that won't be known until the program is running
