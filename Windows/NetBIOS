# NetBIOS

Stands for Network Basic Input Output System. Servers and clients use NetBIOS when viewing network shares on the local area network.

NetBIOS can supply some of the following information when querying a computer:
 •Hostname
 •NetBIOS name
 •Domain
 •Network shares

UDP is used to perform NetBIOS name resolutionand to carry other one-to-many datagram-based communications. By using NetBIOS datagrams, a host can send small messages to many other hosts.

Heavy traffic, such as a file copy, relies on TCP by using NetBIOS sessions.

When an MS Windows machine browses a network, it uses NetBIOS:
  •Datagramsto list the shares and the machines
  •Namesto find workgroups
  •Sessionsto transmit data to and from a Windows share
