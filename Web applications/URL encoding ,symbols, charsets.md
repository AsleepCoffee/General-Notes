URI(uniform resource identifier): Can be a name, locator, or both for an online resource.

URL(uniform resource locator): Just the locator

URLs are a subset of URIs. That means all URLs are URIs. It doesn't work the opposite way though.

## charset https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2978

Contains a set of characters, they represent the set of all symbols that teh end user can display in the browser window. Charset consists of pairs of symbols and code points.

Symbol is what the end user reads.

Code point is the numeric index, used to distinquish the symbol within the charset and can only be shown if the symbol exists in the charset.

Example charsets: ASCII, Unicode, laten-1, etc


ASCII: small set of symbols. was 128 but now is 255. Old & designed to support only US symbols. 


CODE -> HEX -> SYMBOL


Unicode: Standard to allow ppl around the world to use computers in any language. Supports all worlds writing. 

## Character encoding

Is the rep in bytes of the symbols of a charset. A symbol can be rep by 1 or more bytes.

Unicode: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32

\# = bits, more bits = more symbols
