Hash functions has 3 properties: 

- preimage resistance: Not able to find a message that has a given hash

- second preimage resistance: Given an input message, it should be infeasible to find another message with the same hash.

- Collision resistance: Should not be able to find 2 different messages with the same hash. 


All hash and ciphers have an avalanche effect. If a singe bit changes in the message, it will cause a vast change in the final output.
