Symmetric-key cryptography:

- Both the sender and receiver share the same key. Take plain-text and the key and apply the encryption algorithm to get the cipher text. 

Asymmetric-key (public key) cryptography:

Two keys , public and private. Public is given to all, private is kept secret.

Public key is used to encrypt and only private can decrypt.

  Whole concept of public-key is based on the factorization mathematical problem: There is no known efficient method to find all the factors of any big number
