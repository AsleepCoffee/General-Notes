# Malware

•Virus

Small piece of code that spreads from computer to computer, without any direct action or authorization by the owners of the infected machines. Usually copy themselves to special sections of the hard disk, inside legitimate programs or documents. They then run every time an infected program or file is opened

•Trojan Horses

Malware that comes embedded in a seemingly harmless file such as an executable, an MS Office document, a screen saver or a PDF file.When a user opens the malicious file, they fall victim to the malware.

•Rootkit

Malware which is designed to hide itself from users and the antivirus program in order to completely subvert the OS functioning.It lets an attacker maintain privileged access to the victim machine without being noticed.

•Bootkit

Are rootkits which circumvent OS protection mechanisms by executing during the bootstrap phase.They start before the operating system, so they get complete control over the machine and the OS.

•Backdoors

Made by two components: a server and a backdoor client.The Backdoor server runs on the victim machine listening on the network and accepting connections. The client usually runs on the attacker machine, and it is used to connect to the backdoor to control it. A connect-back backdoor, or reverse backdoor, is a common mechanism to bypass firewalls.

•Adware

Annoying software that shows advertisements to computer users

•Spyware

Software used to collect information about users' activity. Spyware collects information such as: •The OS installed on a machine •Visited websites •Passwords. The information is sent back to a log collection server controlled by the attacker.

•Greyware

 General term used to indicate Malware which does not fall under a specific category.For example, it can be either spyware, adware or both.

•Dialer

 Software that tries to dial numbers on dial-up connections in order to collect money from the victim's phone bill. Nowadays, targets smartphones

•Key-logger

 A keylogger is a special software which records every keystroke on the remote victim machine.Operations performed by keyloggers are: •Recording keystrokes •Recording the window name where the victim user was typing  •Saving the keystrokes in a log file on the victim machine  •Sending the logs to a server controlled by the penetration tester
 
   3 types of keyloggers: 
   
     - Software: spawned as software and performs keylogger activites
     
     - Hardware: Small devices you can install between a keyboard and a computer.
     
     - Rootkit: Software keyloggers working at the Kernel level by hijacking the operating system APIsto record keystrokes.Every time a key is pressed on a keyboard, a particular function of the OS Kernel is called through a mechanism called an interrupt. There are many different interrupts in a system, each handling a specific function in the system: reading/writing to disk, calling device drivers, and so on.Every time someone presses a key on a keyboard, the keyboard interrupt is called. The interrupt calls a particular function of the operating system that actually performs the operation intended for the key.By taking control of this function, the rootkit manages to know which key has been pressed and records it for later use.

•Botnet

 Small pieces of software that get installed on millions of Internet-connected machines to perform Distributed Denial of Service or serving as spamming sources.These Bots are commanded remotely by a so-called Command and Controlserver. The C&C server can instruct thousands or even millions of bots to perform a given operation simultaneously.

•Ransomware

 Software that encrypts a computer or smartphone content with a secret key.It then asks its victims for a ransom to give them the content back.

•Data-Stealing Malware

 Has one precise goal: stealing the most important data on the victim's hard disk and sending it back to the attacker. Most of the time, this specific malware incarnation is targetedto a specific company and tailored to work on the target environment.

•Worm

 Spread over the network by exploiting operating systems and software vulnerabilities. Worms can also exploit default credentials or misconfigurations to attack a service or a machine.Usually, worms are part of other malware, and they offer an entry point into the target system.
