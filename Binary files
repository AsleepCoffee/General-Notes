Binary files are hard to understand. When code is written, there are several
more steps before it becomes software. Some parts of this process are:
i.  Compiling, which turns human-readable source code into assembly code.
    Assembly code is difficult for humans to read, but it closely mimics the most
    basic raw instructions that a computer needs in order to run a program.
ii. Assembling, which turns assembly code into machine code. Machine code is
    impossible for humans to read, but this representation is what a computer
    actually needs to execute.

You can run a program called a disassembler to
turn them back into assembly code.

Assembly code contains *instructions* which tell a computer how to update
its own internal memory, and its progress through reading the assembly code
itself. For instance, the `jmp` instruction means "jump to executing a
different instruction", and the `add` instruction means "add two numbers and
store the result in memory
