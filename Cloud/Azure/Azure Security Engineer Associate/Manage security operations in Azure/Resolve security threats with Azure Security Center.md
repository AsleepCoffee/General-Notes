**View security alerts**

Azure Security Center automatically collects, analyzes, and integrates log data from several sources to identify credible threats to your workloads. Data from your Azure resources, the network, and connected partner solutions (like firewalls) is correlated and processed with machine learning and advanced security analytics to reduce false positives.

This aggregation allows Security Center to detect threats such as:

    Compromised VMs communicating with known malicious IP addresses.
    Advanced malware detected by Windows error reporting.
    Brute-force attacks against VMs.
    Security alerts from integrated partner security solutions, such as anti-malware or web application firewalls.

When a threat like this is detected, Security Center will generate a security alert.
