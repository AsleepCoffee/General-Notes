In this unit, you'll gain an understanding of Identity architecture. You'll start by running a script to set up the module's Linux development environment. The script downloads a cross-platform starter project and provisions Azure resources to support tasks throughout the module. Identity will be added to the starter project.

This module focuses on just two of the possible EF Core data stores supported by Identity. Use the toggle above to select your preference.

**Set up development environment**

Run the following command in the command shell. The command reflects your data store choice in the toggle above. Be patient, as setup can take a few minutes to complete. Continue reading while the script runs.
