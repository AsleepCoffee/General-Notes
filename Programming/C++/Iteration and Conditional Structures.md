## Iteration and conditional structures

These structures are useful to instruct the program to execute or to repeat a specific operation when some condition is matched.

A statement is part of our program that can be executed and specifies an action. 

Three main statements: 

 - **SELECTION:** if, switch
 
 - **ITERATION:** while, for, do-while
 
 - **JUMP:** break, continue, goto, return
 
 -
