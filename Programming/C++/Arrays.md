# Arrays

An array is a collection of variables of the same type. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.

     type var_name[size];

       •type declares the type of the array (the type of each element in the array)
       •size defines the length of the array (how many elements the array can contain)

All arrays have 0 as an index of the first element. Therefore, if we declare an array of 10 elements its index goes from [0] to [9].
