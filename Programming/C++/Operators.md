# Operators

Four main classes of operators:

 - Arithmetic
 
 - Relational
 
 - Logical 
 
 - Bitwise



## Assignment operator

      variable_name = expression;

 Can be used within any valid expression. The target (the left part –variable name) of the assignment must be a variable or a pointer  and can’t be a function or a constant.

In C++ literature, you will see these two terms: lvalue and rvalue.
 
   •lvalueis any label that appears on the left side of an assignment statement; in other words, we can say it is the variable name.
   
   •rvaluerefers to expressions/value on the right side of an assignment and simply means the value that will be assigned to the variable.

  There is also the increment operator (++) and decrement operator (--)
  
  
      ++a;    ++ adds 1 to the operand
      --a;    -- sub 1 from the operand
