Programming langauges can be divided into two main group: 

 **- Low-level languages:**
    Low level languagesareinterpreted directly by the computer.Theiradvantage is thatyou can do almost everything in them, while their disadvantage is theircomplicatednaturethat can lead to a vulnerability, if the developer doesn’t have a deep understanding of the language’s capabilities. Such as code tht will operate directly on computer memory.
    
     Examples: assembly (instructions of the processor itself, used in advanced exploitation)
     
     
 
 **- High-level languages:**
    High level languagesoffer ease of development, but they are less flexible. If there are no available libraries that hold certain functionality, writing custom functionality from scratch might be a very difficult task. Offer much more development convenience and support broaderoperations. Lots of single hardware operations are invisibly managed by the language engine. Such as fancy GUI along with graphical libraries.
    
      Examples: Java, Python, Visual Basic.

  Programs created using high-level languages cannot reside on a bare operating system and will need some software already installed on the system to run. i.e Java programs require "Java Runtime Environment" to be installed.
 
The level can tell how close they are to the hardware.
